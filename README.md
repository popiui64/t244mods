These mods illustrate some of the basics of modding using Forge. They are listed in approximate order of increased complexity.

You are free to use this code for any purpose, but it comes with no guarantees of any kind. It works for me and makes sense to me, but may not for you.

EmptyMod
--------

This is pretty much the bare minimum mod. It does nothing except require its own presence on both the client and server.

SmeltingMod
-----------

Illustrates how to add new smelting recipes, by adding several to recycle iron from various blocks and items that are crafted from iron. (requires NewItemMod)

CraftingMod
-----------

Illustrates how to add a new shaped crafting recipe.

NewBlockMod
-----------

Illustrates how to add a new block, give it a name and texture, and change what it drops when broken.

NewItemMod
----------

Illustrates how to add a new item: iron nuggets.

LightningAspectMod
------------------

*INCOMPLETE*

Shows how to add a new sword enchantment. The enchantment causes any mob you attack to be struck by lightning. If used in survival mode, you will also be harmed by the lightning bolt. Forge currently lacks a system for getting an unused enchantment ID, so we do our best to find one, but things still might confilct with other enchantment mods. This mod also does not currently provide a localizable name for the enchantment.
